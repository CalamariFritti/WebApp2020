Muggefug e.V. student music club in Cottbus
The muggefug e.V. is one of the oldest still active student clubs in Cottbus, founded in 1994 we are home to a wide variety of concerts, movie nights, readings and all kind of cultural events.
We are especially famous for our concerts and mini-festivals where local and not so local bands perform on our stage, with our specialities being metal, punk and hardcore-concerts of various flavours. Since our beginnings we established as a constant in the club scene of Cottbus and managed to grow fond to an ever-growing fanbase. We want to be more than a mere “location for loud music and mediocre music”, as this is what it seems to be the goal of some cultural locations, not only in Cottbus. We want to be a home for musicians, music-lovers and enthusiast of all kind.

# BusinessActivities
Muggefug e.V. is a charitable, non-profit organisation run by students. We offer a classic student club atmosphere in one of the housing buildings right on the campus of the Brandenburgische Technische Universität in Cottbus. We own a fully equipped stage for concerts and events of all kind, as well as a fully equipped and (hopefully) full stocked bar for our guests. 
We also organise outdoor events alone or in cooperation with other cultural institutions in Cottbus, so we usually have a vegan street party in summer or are part of several smaller or larger musical festivals in and around Cottbus.
Muggefug e.V. is also home to the campus movie nights, where students and staff of the university can watch movies, both new and old, on our very comfortable couches.
But the main focus is and always was on music and concerts, as the love for music unites us. And as a student club with limited financial resources, we always look for enthusiastic people with ideas who just need a place, or in our case, a stage to fulfil their dreams.

# PurposeOfTheApp
And to become the dream fulfilling frame for creative ideas from on and around Cottbus, we want to setup a new app, that enables everybody to plan and organise their concert in our club. So we want to provide an easy way to set-up a number of artists on a specific date to play a concert. It is a bit more than just a simple booking calendar, because by growing and maintaining a data-base filled with musicians and bands and filled by everyone, we want to improve our program. 
Our new app should be able to set a date and a name and also a title for your event and we want to let the user ‘book’ the bands he or she knows will play at this concert.
And by letting our concert-goers create the line-up on stage for their own concert, we plan to make our club even more a true home to music enthusiast.
